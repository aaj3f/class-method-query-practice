# Model Class Methods & ActiveRecord Queries (EXTRA PRACTICE)

## Intro

I built this as a follow-up to a Flatiron lab on Model Class Methods using ActiveRecord::QueryMethods.

If you're like me, then you might enjoy a few more examples to practice with until you feel comfortable chaining those query methods together.

I highly recommend reading first the [Rails Guide to ActiveRecord Querying](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html), especially sections 1-7, 12, & 13.

For a top-level summary of why it's worthwhile to chain ActiveRecord::QueryMethods together (and why it uses Relation objects instead of arrays), I also recommend reading [this blog post by The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/active-record-queries).

## Getting Started

Fork & Clone down this repo, and then run `rake db:migrate && rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`

Then just start working with the Rspec tests included in the lab (using `rspec` instead of `learn`).
